        <hr>
        <p><h3>When India achieved independence on 15th August 1947, 
            newspapers all over the world were flooded with headlines that 
            tried to capture the essence of that historical day. 
            On the 73rd anniversary of India's Independence Day,
             let us look back at some of the headlines
              from that fateful day.</h3></p>
        <pre> 
            <h2>
            Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, 
            and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge,
            not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. 
            At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps,
            India will awake to life and freedom. 
            A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history
            when we step out from the old to the new when an age ends,
            and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. 
            It is fitting that at this solemn moment, 
            we take the pledge of dedication to the service of
            India and her people and to the still larger cause of humanity.

            Independence Day, one of the three National holidays in India (the other two being the Republic Day on 26 January and Mahatma Gandhi's birthday on 2 October), is observed in all Indian states and union territories. On the eve of Independence Day, the President of India delivers the "Address to the Nation". On 15 August, the Prime Minister hoists the Indian flag on the ramparts of the historical site of Red Fort in Delhi. In his speech, the Prime Minister highlights the past year's achievements, raises important issues and calls for further development. He pays tribute to the leaders of the Indian independence movement. The Indian national anthem, "Jana Gana Mana", is sung. The speech is followed by a march past of divisions of the Indian Armed Forces and paramilitary forces. Parades and pageants showcase scenes from the independence struggle and India's diverse cultural traditions. Similar events take place in state capitals where the Chief Ministers of individual states unfurl the national flag, followed by parades and pageants. Until 1973, the Governor of the State hoisted the National Flag at the State capital. In February 1974, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Karunanidhi took up the issue with then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi that the Chief Ministers, like the Prime Minister, should be allowed to hoist the national flag on Independence Day. Since 1974, Chief Ministers of the respective states have been allowed to hoist the national flag on Independence Day.

                “If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes it worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there's room to hear more subtle things - that's when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse in the moment. You see so much more than you could see before. It's a discipline; you have to practice it.”
